\section{Introduction}
\begin{comment}ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.
\end{comment}
This paper explores the topic of datacenter networks, focusing on the challenges in managing datacenter traffic. Datacenter networks provide multiple paths for traffic between machines, and effective load balancing across these paths is crucial for applications sensitive to latency and throughput. When traffic is not evenly distributed, some paths can become congested while others are underutilized, negatively impacting network throughput and increasing tail latency for flows. High tail latency in datacenter applications directly affects the end-user experience because user responses are aggregated from the results of thousands of servers, making the tail latency of individual flows a bottleneck for response time.

A commonly used load-balancing mechanism in datacenter networks is Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP) forwarding. This method randomly assigns flows to different paths by hashing specific fields in the packet headers, ensuring that packets within a flow follow the same path. Although ECMP is widely adopted because it works seamlessly with off-the-shelf switches and standard TCP/IP stacks, it has limitations in handling datacenter traffic effectively. In real-world applications, datacenter traffic often includes a small number of long flows that contribute a significant portion of the total traffic load. These long flows lack sufficient entropy for uniform load distribution, causing multiple long flows to collide on the same paths, leading to prolonged congestion, while other paths remain underutilized.

Several recent approaches have attempted to address ECMP's shortcomings. MPTCP, an end-to-end scheme, dynamically adapts to network conditions, unlike the static nature of ECMP. However, MPTCP introduces significant overhead in managing packet reordering. Random Packet Scatter (RPS) is a static solution that also experiences high levels of packet reordering. Other methods, like DeTail, require hardware-level changes, which are costly and hinder continuous deployment.

In this paper, the researchers propose FlowBender, a dynamic alternative to ECMP that minimizes packet reordering. FlowBender addresses ECMP's core limitation: the flow-to-path mapping is static; there is no consideration for re-routing if the current path is congested or even broken. FlowBenderâ€™s design is based on the observation that a small number of long flows contribute a large fraction of network load. To mitigate congestion, FlowBender selectively reroutes flows only during congestion or route failures, thus avoiding unnecessary packet reordering costs.

FlowBender offers several advantages: it requires no hardware changes to switch silicon, involves only 50 lines of kernel code modifications, and can be implemented with simple reconfiguration of ECMP hash functions (through a few commands). It significantly outperforms ECMP and matches the performance of more complex schemes. Additionally, FlowBender incorporates robust end-to-end congestion notifications (ECN) and failure signals (timeouts). It reroutes at the granularity of Round-Trip Time (RTT) and quickly recovers from link failures within a timeout period.

The researchers evaluated FlowBender through both simulations and real-world implementation. Their results indicate that FlowBender reduces tail latency by over 40\% on average for large flows compared to ECMP. In large-scale ns-3 simulations using datacenter-like workloads, FlowBender decreases the mean and tail latency of all-to-all workloads by 73\% and 93\%, respectively, compared to ECMP, while performing within 2\% of costlier alternatives like DeTail and RPS. For storage-type workloads that produce incast traffic, FlowBender enables jobs to complete in half to a quarter of the time compared to ECMP, closely matching the performance of more complex schemes like DeTail and RPS (within 2\% in average completion time and tail latency). Overall, FlowBender demonstrates the effectiveness of a non-intrusive, flow-level load balancing solution based on the classic end-to-end principle.



\section{Approach Overview}
As noted in the introduction, this paper examines the challenges of load balancing in data center networks, emphasizing the importance of evenly distributing traffic across multiple paths to prevent congestion. This section will delve into the primary issues faced by data centers in detail and discuss current solutions, along with their strengths and weaknesses.

\subsection{Main Problem}

ECMP is the standard mechanism used in datacenters for load balancing data across multiple paths. In ECMP, the switch calculates a hash function based on the packetâ€™s header fields. The resulting hash value determines the port used to forward the packet. ECMP assigns flows to paths based on this static hash value derived from each flowâ€™s identifying fields. Once a flow is assigned to a path, it consistently uses that same path, with no dynamic adjustment based on traffic conditions. For short-lived flows, this design works effectively. However, issues arise with long-lived flows (flows that persist for an extended period), as they can lead to collisions. When two flows generate the same hash value, they collide and are assigned to the same path, regardless of other available paths. If these flows are long-lived, they will continuously occupy and congest that path. Because ECMPâ€™s flow-to-path assignment is static, it cannot redistribute or rebalance these long flows across other, less congested paths.

\begin{comment}
Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{acmsmall}}: The default journal template style.
\item {\texttt{acmlarge}}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\texttt{acmtog}}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{acmconf}}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\texttt{sigchi}}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\texttt{sigplan}}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}

\subsection{Existing Solutions}
Many solutions aim to achieve better load balancing in datacenters and address the issues associated with ECMP. MPTCP (Multipath TCP) splits a single TCP flow into multiple subflows, each with a different port number. Since port numbers are part of the ECMP hashing function, these distinct subflows are hashed to different paths in the network, distributing the traffic load more evenly. By splitting traffic across multiple paths, MPTCP helps avoid the problem that arises when ECMP assigns long flows to the same path, allowing for dynamic traffic distribution based on network conditions. In MPTCP, the sender has additional responsibilities: it monitors metrics such as Round-Trip Time (RTT), throughput, and packet loss for each subflow and prioritizes paths with better performance. The receiver, on the other hand, requires extra logic to reassemble data from multiple subflows back into the original stream, which adds complexity. MPTCP has demonstrated improvements over ECMP for larger flows (those over 70 KB) as it effectively balances load across multiple paths, avoiding the limitations of ECMPâ€™s static path assignment for long flows. However, MPTCP has some drawbacks. The congestion control algorithm on the sender side and the data reassembly logic on the receiver side are complex, adding over 10,000 lines of kernel code. This complexity can slow down performance and increase the difficulty of implementation and maintenance. Additionally, MPTCP incurs significant CPU overhead, consuming around 40\% of CPU on clients and 10\% on serversâ€”considered excessive for datacenter environments.

On the other hand, Random Packet Spraying (RPS) and DeTail shift the responsibility for load balancing to the network switches. RPS operates at the packet level rather than the flow level, meaning each packet within a flow can take a different path through the network. For every packet, the switch randomly selects an output port from a set of available ports, independently forwarding each packet along different paths. RPS performs well in symmetric topologies like fat-tree structures, where paths between devices are balanced and equal. In such cases, packets reach their destinations efficiently, even when they are randomly sprayed across paths. However, when the network experiences asymmetriesâ€”due to link failures or incremental deployments (where new equipment is added over time)â€”RPS can lead to significant throughput inefficiencies, as it may overload some paths while underutilizing others.

DeTail overcomes RPSâ€™s limitations by combining Priority Flow Control (PFC) and adaptive routing to enhance tail latency and network utilization. PFC ensures lossless packet forwarding by preventing packet drops. However, PFC comes with challenges, such as the risk of network deadlock (when packets are indefinitely stuck in the network) and head-of-line (HOL) blocking within the same priority class, which can delay traffic. DeTail uses a form of adaptive routing where each packet chooses the least congested eligible port at each switch. This strategy helps reduce congestion by dynamically balancing traffic based on real-time network conditions. However, adaptive routing also presents challenges. It requires custom switch silicon to monitor queue lengths in real-time and to forward packets accordingly. This specialized hardware is expensive and has long production cycles, making rapid deployment challenging. Another issue is that, since DeTail performs load balancing at the per-packet level, packets can take different paths, leading to out-of-order delivery. This disrupts the TCP flow and disables TCPâ€™s fast retransmit feature, which is used to quickly resend lost packets. Lastly, because DeTail operates at the link layer, it cannot manage failures on paths that have only one way to reach the destination. If a link fails in a part of the network where there is no alternate path (a deterministic part of the path), DeTail cannot reroute around the failure. It lacks mechanisms to switch the flow to an entirely different route that bypasses the failed link.
 


In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{anonymous,review}}: Suitable for a ``double-blind''
  conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
  numbers. Use with the \texttt{\acmSubmissionID} command to print the
  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item{\texttt{authorversion}}: Produces a version of the work suitable
  for posting by the author.
\item{\texttt{screen}}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the
source file:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
document:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
%\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
%\item the conference information in the page header(s).
%\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey whatâ€™s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{Multi-language papers}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
the following command
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
of their usage.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
\item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
\end{description}

%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
